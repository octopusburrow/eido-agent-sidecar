 * `@animalabs/mcpl-core@0.2.1` still carries the 0.4 shapes: its
 * `FeatureSetDeclaration` requires the removed `hostState` and carries a `name`
 * member the 0.5 schema does not define (App. B.2), its `FeatureSetsUpdateParams`
 * has no `effectiveCapabilities`/`deniedCapabilities`, and there is no
 * degradation-receipt type. Nothing is published yet, so the types below are
 * written against SPEC.md (0.5.0-draft) directly and this module is the single
 * place that has to change when the core library catches up.
 *
 * Everything here is pure — no I/O, no connection state — so the fail-closed
 * derivation can be unit-tested (test/policy.test.ts).
